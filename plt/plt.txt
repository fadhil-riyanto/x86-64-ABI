Procedure Linkage Table (PLT) is used to call external functions defined
in shared libraries.  For PLT, which satisfies the following conditions:

1. PLT entries transfer control to external functions via indirect branch
over the corresponding entry in Global Offset Table (GOT) referenced by
R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT relocation.  A PLT entry may look like

  jmp     *foo@GOTPCREL(%rip)
  pushq   $foo_relocation_index
  jmp     .PLT0

or

  endbr64
  jmp     *foo@GOTPCREL(%rip)
  nop
  
2. The only entry point of a PLT entry is the first byte of the entry.
3. When resolving R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT relocation to update the GOT entry,
dynamic linker ignores the r_addend field of R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT
relocation.  Starting from glibc 2.33 branch, r_addend is ignored by

f8587a6189 x86-64: Ignore r_addend for R_X86_64_GLOB_DAT/R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT

4. All entries have the same size and are aligned to the entry size.

define dynamic tags:

#define DT_X86_64_PLT       (DT_LOPROC + 0)
#define DT_X86_64_PLTSZ     (DT_LOPROC + 1)
#define DT_X86_64_PLTENT    (DT_LOPROC + 3)

DT_X86_64_PLT: The address of PLT.
DT_X86_64_PLTSZ: The total size, in bytes, of PLT.
DT_X86_64_PLTENT: The size, in bytes, of a PLT entry.

Since the r_addend field of R_X86_64_JUMP_SLOT relocation is ignored, it
is repurposed to store the offset, in bytes, of the indirect branch in the
corresponding PLT entry.  Together, they can be used by dynamic linker to
rewrite PLT entry.
